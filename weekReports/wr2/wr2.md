# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:** The operating system is a piece of software that manages the computer hardware and software resources. The operating system also contains services which some applications require to run.
* **Kernel:** The kernel is the core component of the operating system that allows it to interact with the hardware.
* **Components of an operating system:** These components include applications, graphical desktop environments, daemons, shells, and the kernel.
* **Linux :** Linux is an operating system based on Unix that is focused on productivity and modularity.
* **Linux Characteristics:** Some of the characteristics of Linux include the fact that it is open-source, it works on almost any system, and it is highly scalable for servers.
* **GNU Toolchain:** A set of programming tools based in Linux.
* **Linux Distribution:** Different "flavors" of Linux that are each suited for different workloads or processes.
* **What is Ubuntu:** Ubuntu is a linux distribution that is very accessible and available as it is open source and has support for many languages.
* **Ubuntu Release cycles:** Regular updates are shipped every 6 months/supported for 9 months and Long-Term Support updates are shipped every 2 years and are supported for 5 years.
* **What is Debian:** Debian is a Linux distribution that is known to be the "grandfather" of all Linux distributions, with Ubuntu being its user-friendly version.
* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):** Open source generally means the software in question is free and the source code is readable and modifiable without a license, while closed source means you cannot view/edit the source code of the software.
* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:** 
* Software can be used for any purpose
* Source code can be viewed
* Software is able to be redistributed free of charge
* Modified software is also able to be redistributed
* **Virtualization:** A technology that is used to let multiple operating systems run on one computer.
* **Hypervisor and types:**
* Hardware Hypervisor (bare-metal): An "operating system" that runs directly on the hardware that allows for much faster virtualization than software hypervisors.
* Software Hypervisor: An application that runs on top of the operating system.
* **VirtualBox:** Virtualbox is a software hypervisor that allows for virtualization of most operating systems.
